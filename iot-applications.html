    <h3>ACTIVITY 1</h3><br>
    <div>
      <p>Analysis of enormous amounts of data from numerous connected sensors. where we may develop a variety of services and
        <br>solutions with the aid of A.I. and M.L. where we may acquire IOT-based applications with smart security, networking, 
        <br>integration, automation, scaling, sensing, and many other characteristics. implementing in Google Home, smart homes, 
        <br>internet retail, and the healthcare industry</p>
        </div>

    <h3>ACTIVITY 2</h3>
    <div><p>To illustrate what we mean by a "smart building," let's use the example of Schiphol, a self-sufficient airport in the Netherlands. 
        <br>Without a human attendant present, the entire system uses A.I., and M.L. passengers must arrive 16 minutes before takeoff. 
        <br>Integrators of security systems offer technical advice to the airport, offer and instal solutions, and perform upkeep and repairs. 
        <br>Intelligent cameras to count and monitor crowds. weather prediction software. System for integrated transaction management. 
        <br>Based on time, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning). These are some of the key roles that A.I. and M.L. 
        <br>IOT-application play in controlling the airport.</p> </div>

    <h3>ACTIVITY 3</h3>
    <div>
      <p>When it comes to the control interface, we have Varied devices have different user interfaces, such as the TV remote control, 
        <br>which has a number of buttons, and gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which may be operated by voice commands. The high level features 
        <br>of this display, such as Display Hierarchy, Contents of Displays, Display Layout, Abbreviations and Labels, Alarms, Text Messages, 
        <br>Lines, and Arrows, are made possible by this. Customers, shopkeepers, visitors, security personnel, and local people can use it 
        <br>for their daily needs. allowing them to use the IoT-enabled devices in ease. Their encounters will be simple.
